### The Elmore Delay

> Basic idea: use of **mean** of $v'(t)$ to approximate **median** of $v'(t)$

> Elmore delay approximates the **median** of $h(t)$ by the **mean** of $h(t)$

### Distributed RC-Line

### Lumped approximations

#### $rc$-models

If your simulator does not support a distributed $rc$-model, or if the computational complexity of these models slows down your simulation too much, you can construct a simple yet accurate model yourself by approximating the distributed $rc$ by a lumped RC network with a limited number of elements

> The accuracy of the model is determined by the number of stages. For instance, the error of the $\Pi -3$ model is less than 3%, which is generally sufficient.



#### Why use "$\Pi$ Model"

## Wire Inductive Effect

- RC delay increases quadratically with length
- LC delay (speed of light flight time) increases linearly with length

> Inductance will only be important to the delay of low-resistance signals such as wide clock lines





### wave

Signal propagates over the wire as a **wave** (rather than **diffusing** as in $rc$ only models)

> Signal propagates by alternately transferring energy from capacitive to inductive modes
