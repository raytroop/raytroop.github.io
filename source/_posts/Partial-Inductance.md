The concept of **partial inductance** is extensively used in the book for modeling interconnects and discontinuities (self and mutual ***loop*** inductances  ->  ***partial*** inductance)

## loop inductance

> 由法拉第定律所導出的total loop inductance是迴路整體的效應，沒辦法區分出電源與地路徑上各別的電感，即難以分析 電感對power bounce或ground bounce分別的影響，所以有了partial inductance的定義

## partial inductance

##   Current Return Path

![image-20250705171613361](Partial-Inductance/image-20250705171613361.png)

Current return paths are frequency dependent $Z = R +j\omega L$

- Low frequency
  - $R$ dominates - current use as many returns as possible to have parallel resistances
- High frequency
  - $j\omega L$​ dominates - current use the *closest possible return path* to form *the smallest possible loop inductance*
- Very high frequency
  - The current would be confined to the *nearest* possible return only at ultra-high frequencies (skin effect)

## proximity effect & skin effect 

- *Skin effect* concentrates current near the ***surface*** of a single conductor, while *proximity effect* concentrates current in ***specific regions*** of multiple conductors due to their interaction
- *Skin effect* is caused by the conductor's ***own*** magnetic field, while proximity effect is caused by the magnetic field of a ***nearby*** conductor

---

***proximity effect*** is a *redistribution of electric current* occurring in ***nearby parallel electrical conductors*** carrying *alternating current (AC)*, caused by ***magnetic effects*** (eddy currents)

![image-20250705163405433](Partial-Inductance/image-20250705163405433.png)

---

***skin effect*** is the tendency of ***AC current*** flow near the surface (or "skin") of a conductor, rather than throughout its cross-section, due to the ***magnetic field generated by the current itself***

![image-20250705165353751](Partial-Inductance/image-20250705165353751.png)

> ***Cause of skin effect***
>
> A main current $I$ flowing through a conductor induces a magnetic field $H$. If the current increases, as in this figure, the resulting increase in $H$ induces separate, circulating ***eddy currents*** $I_W$ which partially cancel the current flow in the center and reinforce it near the skin

---

***Eddy current***

By [Lenz's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz's_law), an eddy current creates a magnetic field that ***opposes*** the change in the magnetic field that created it, and thus eddy currents ***react back*** on the source of the magnetic field



## Electromagnetic coupling

**Electric field coupling** (also called **capacitive coupling**) occurs when energy is coupled from one circuit to another through an **electric field**

![Two circuits above a signal return plane.](Partial-Inductance/Fig01.png)

**Magnetic field coupling** (also called **inductive coupling**) occurs when energy is coupled from one circuit to another through a **magnetic field**

For instance

- magnetic coupling between multiple inductors
- capacitive coupling between multiple transmission lines
