This **cascode compensation** topology is popularly known as **ahuja compensation**

The cause of the positive zero is the *feedforward current through $C_m$*.

To abolish this zero, we have to cut the feedforward path and create a unidirectional feedback through $C_m$.

1. Adding a resistor(nulling resistor) is one way to mitigate the effect of the feedforward current.

2. Another approach uses a current buffer cascode to pass the small-signal feedback current but cut the feedforward current

> People name this approach after the author *Ahuja*


The benefits of *Ahuja* compensation over Miller compensation are severa

- better PSRR

- higher unity-gain bandwidth using smaller compensation capacitor

- ability to cope better with heavy capacitive and resistive loads



## Miller's approximation

### Right-Half-Plane Zero

$$
\left[(v_i - v_o)sC_c - g_m v_i\right]R_o = v_o
$$
Then
$$
\frac{v_o}{v_i} = -g_mR_o\frac{1-s\frac{C_c}{g_m}}{1+sR_oC_c}
$$
 right-half-plane Zero $\omega _z = \frac{g_m}{C_c}$

### Equivalent cap

The amplifier gain magnitude $A_v = g_m R_o$
$$
I_\text{c,in} = (v_i - v_o)sC_c
$$
Then
$$\begin{align}
I_\text{c,in}  &= (v_i + A_v v_i)sC_c \\
& = v_i s (1+A_v)C_c
\end{align}$$

we get $C_\text{in,eq}= (1+A_v)C_c\simeq A_vC_c$

Similarly
$$\begin{align}
I_\text{c,out}  &= (v_o - v_i)sC_c \\
& = v_o s (1+\frac{1}{A_v})C_c
\end{align}$$

we get $C_\text{out,eq}= (1+\frac{1}{A_v})C_c\simeq C_c$

Of course, , if the capacitance at the gate of $M_1$ is taken into account, pole splitting is less pronounced.

**including $r_\text{o2}$**

![image-20240819202642809](ahuja/image-20240819202642809.png)
$$
\frac{V_{out}}{I_{in}} \approx \frac{-g_{m1}R_SR_L(g_{m2}+C_Cs)}{\frac{R_S+r_\text{o2}}{r_\text{o2}}R_LC_LC_Cs^2+g_{m1}g_{m2}R_LR_SC_Cs+g_{m2}}
$$
The poles as

$$\begin{align}
\omega_{p1} &\approx  \frac{1}{g_{m1}R_LR_SC_c} \\
\omega_{p2} &\approx \frac{g_{m2}R_Sg_{m1}}{C_L}\frac{r_\text{o2}}{R_S+r_\text{o2}}
\end{align}$$

and zero is not affected, which is $\omega_z =\frac{g_{m2}}{C_C}$



the above model simulation result is shown below

> the zero is located between two poles



take into the capacitance at the gate of $M_1$ and all other second-order effect

## intuitive analysis of zero

miller compensation

- zero in the **right** half plane
  $$
  g_\text{m1}V_P = sC_c V_P
  $$
  

cascode compensation

- zero in the **left** half plane
  $$
  g_\text{m2}V_X = - sC_c V_X
  $$

## How to Mitigate Impact of Zero



![cascode_compensation](ahuja/cascode_compensation.PNG)

**dominant pole** 
$$
\omega_\text{p,d} = \frac {1} {R_\text{eq}g_\text{m9}R_{L}C_{c}}
$$
**first nondominant pole**
$$
\omega_\text{p,nd} = \frac {g_\text{m4}R_\text{eq}g_\text{m9}} {C_L}
$$
**zero** 
$$
\omega_\text{z} = (g_\text{m4}R_\text{eq})(\frac {g_\text{m9}} {C_c})
$$
a much greater magnitude than $g_\text{m9}/C_C$
