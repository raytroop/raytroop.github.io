> To understand the impact of the clock jitter on the performance of a wireline system, *the transfer functions of the PLL in the transmitter side* and *the CDR loop in the receiver* should be taken into consideration

> *the **minimum** jitter* occurs at the point where the *transmit PLL UGB is **minimum*** and the *CDR UGB is **maximized***

- the net rms jitter that impacts the performance of a wireline transceiver is much lower than the rms jitter of the transmit PLL
- the jitter requirements of the transmit PLL on the wireline system is much more relaxed compared to the wireless transceiver
