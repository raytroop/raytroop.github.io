  - Holding/clamping voltage **Vh**

## Secondary protection

![img](esd/esd2ndprotect.png.jpg)

1. Adding a (small) clamp behind the isolation resistance can extend the ESD design window, e.g. enabling dual diode protection for thin oxide transistors.
2. ESD current through this clamp will build-up voltage across the isolation resistance, while protecting the circuit. 
3. The higher voltage at the IN pad will then trigger the primary protection (red current path)

Adding a (small) clamp behind the isolation resistance can extend the **ESD design window**, e.g. enabling dual diode protection for thin oxide transistors

![img](esd/secondaryprotection-window.png)

Extended ESD design window example. The failure voltage of a thin gate oxide in advanced CMOS is about 4V. The primary ESD solution (red IV curve) introduces too much voltage. Thanks to an isolation resistance between primary and secondary local clamp device (green IV curve) additional margin is created.

![Example TLP characteristics using TLP](esd/TLP-characteristics-using-TLP.PNG)

Vt1: trigger voltage

Vhold: holding voltage

soft failure current: Isoft

hard failure current: **It2**



### TLP vs ESD

- **ESD** tests simulate real world events (HBM, MM, CDM)
- **TLP** does not simulate any real-world event
- **ESD** tests record failure level (*Qualification*)
- **TLP** tests record failure level and device behavior (*Characterization*)

> TLP is not a qualification test, but a characterization method, which describes the resistance of a device for a given stimulus, aka. *Device Characterization*
>
> Unlike ESD waveforms, TLP does not mimic any real world event

![image-20220609234548431](esd/image-20220609234548431.png)

### TLP  and Curve Tracing

- Curve Tracing is DC; TLP is a short pulse
  - Shorter pulse - Reduced duty cycle, less heating, which means higher voltage before failure
  - Controlled Impedance - Allows device behavior to be observed
- Both measure resistance of device with increasing voltage

![image-20220609235252444](esd/image-20220609235252444.png)

### Device Characterization with TLP

- Turn-on time
- Snapback voltage
- Performance changes with rise time

### VF-TLP and CDM differences

Question:

How well will VF-TLP results predict CDM testing performance?

Answer:

VF-TLP can be a guide to CDM failure levels, and provide a lot of understanding of a circuit's operation during CDM stressing, but simple correlations between VF-TLP failure current level and CDM withstand voltage levels are difficult to establish.

### I.V and Leakage Evolution Plots

DC leakage current data combined with the I-V data provides electrical indications of where damage begins, and how rapidly it can evolve from soft to hard failures

## Snapback

Unfortunately, this protection concept is not effective anymore in advanced FinFET technology.
Our analysis showed that both core and IO transistors are damaged at the onset of snapback in several FinFET processes.

## Safe operating area (SOA)

![image-20241120210746211](esd/image-20241120210746211.png)



## power clamp

Thanks to the device scaling the area is actually reasonable. However, the leakage becomes the main bottleneck.

### Positive ESD transient at I/O pad

![image-20220623233019912](esd/image-20220623233019912.png)

1. **DB** junction is reverse-biased all the way to its breakdown.
2. Avalance multiplication takes place and generates electron-hole pairs
3. Hole current flows into the ground via the **B-region** and build up a potential, VR, across the lateral parasitic resistance R
4. As VR increases, the **BS** junction turns on, eventually triggers the parasitic lateral NPN transistor Q (**DBS**)

### Negative ESD transient at I/O pad

![image-20220623233634452](esd/image-20220623233634452.png)

 The forward-biased parasitic diode, **BD**, will shunt the transient

> These GPIO is self-protective thanks to the ggNMOS.
