### Two-Side Poly Contact & folding

![image-20230709212015293](gate-resistance/image-20230709212015293.png)

Both scheme yield a total distributed resistance of $R_G/4$ for gate noise calculation



#### folding

finger 0
$$\begin{align}
\overline{i_{tot,0}^2} &= \left(\frac{g_m}{2} \right)^2(4kT\frac{R_G/2}{3}) \\
&= g_m^2\left(4kT\frac{R_G}{3}\right)\frac{1}{2^2\cdot 2}
\end{align}$$

similarly finger 1
$$
\overline{i_{tot,1}^2} = g_m^2\left(4kT\frac{R_G}{3}\right)\frac{1}{2^2\cdot 2}
$$
Assuming uncorrelated
$$
\overline{i_{tot}^2} = \sum_{N=0}^1\overline{i_{tot,N}^2} =g_m^2\left(4kT\frac{R_G}{3}\right)\frac{1}{2^2\cdot 2} \cdot 2 = g_m^2\left(4kT\frac{R_G}{3}\right)\frac{1}{2^2}
$$
Generally
$$
\overline{i_{tot}^2} = g_m^2\left(4kT\frac{R_G}{3}\right)\frac{1}{N^2}
$$
where the gate is decomposed into $N$ parallel fingers

**We fracture Gate poly at the center point,  then we obtain 2 segments, both have same $\frac{g_m}{2}$ and  $R_G/2$.**

The derivation procedure is same with folding structure, i.e. plug $N=2$ into $\overline{i_{tot}^2} = g_m^2\left(4kT\frac{R_G}{3}\right)\frac{1}{N^2}$

That is
$$
\overline{i_{tot}^2} = g_m^2\left(4kT\frac{R_G}{12}\right)
$$
The input referred noise of  gate resistance
$$
\overline{V_{nRG}^2} = 4kT\frac{R_G}{12}
$$



###  four equal gate fingers

![image-20230709212818351](gate-resistance/image-20230709212818351.png)

$$
\overline{i_{tot}^2} = g_m^2\left(4kT\frac{R_G}{3}\right)\frac{1}{4^2}
$$
Then
$$
\overline{V_{nRG}^2} = \frac{\overline{i_{tot}^2}}{g_m^2} =4kT\frac{R_G}{48}
$$




## Gate resistance handling by parasitic extraction tools

They fracture the poly line at the intersection with the active (diffusion) layer, breaking it into **"gate poly"(poly over active)** and **"field poly" (poly outside active)**

Gate poly is also fractured at the center point. Gate instance pin of the MOSFET (SPICE model) is connected to the center point of the gate poly. **Gate poly is described by two parasitic resistors, connecting the fracture points**.

MOSFET extrinsic parasitic capacitance between gate poly and source / drain diffusion and contacts is calculated by parasitic extraction tools, and assigned to the nodes of the resistive networks.

Different extraction tools do this differently - some tools connect these parasitic capacitances to the center point of the gate poly, while some other tools connect them to the end points of the gate poly resistors.



## $\Delta$ gate model

> This distributed network has a different AC and transient response than a simple lumped one-R and one-C circuit.
>
> It was shown [B. Razavi] that such RC network behaves approximately the same as a network with one R and one C element, where *C is the total capacitance*, and R=1/3 * W/L *rsh for single-side connected poly, and R=1/12 * W/L * rsh for double-sided connected poly.
>
> These coefficients - 1/3 and 1/12 - effectively enable an accurate reduced order model for the gate, reducing a large number of R and C elements to two (or three) resistors and one capacitor.



**Gate Delta Model**:  where a gate is described by two positive and one negative resistors

> only applicable to contacts on gate overhangs
>
> invalid for self-aligned gate contacts, where gate contact land directly on top of gate, not gate overhang

1. 1-side gate contact
   $$
   R_{eq,1side} =R_1 \parallel (R_2+R_1)= \frac{R_G}{6}\parallel (-\frac{R_G}{2}+\frac{R_G}{6})=\frac{R_G}{3}
   $$

2. 2-side contact
   $$
   R_{eq,2side}= R_1 \parallel R_1 = \frac{R_G}{6}\parallel \frac{R_G}{6} = \frac{R_G}{12}
   $$



> Some SPICE simulators have problems handling *negative resistors*, that's possibly why this model did not get a wide adoption. Some foundries and PDKs support delta gate model, while some others don't.



## Vertical component of gate resistance

In "old" technologies (pre-16nm), gate resistance was dominated by lateral resistance. However, in advanced technologies, multiple interfaces between gate material layers lead to a large vertical gate resistance.

![No alt text provided for this image](gate-resistance/1678686425859.png)

> It's very easy to check this in DSPF file - if gate instance pin is connected directly to the center of the gate poly - vertical resistance is not accounted for. If it is connected by a positive resistor to the center of the gate poly - that resistors represents the vertical gate resistance.


## decap

![decap-res.drawio](gate-resistance/decap-res.drawio.svg)

leakage current is determined by $R_s + R_p$, and $R_p \gg R_s$

- low freq: $Z=R_s + R_p$
- high freq: $Z=R_s$

> An example: $R_s=200\space \Omega$, $R_p = 8 \space M\Omega$ and $C_\text{gate}=10\space fF$
