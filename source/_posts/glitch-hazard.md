- A **glitch** is an unwanted pulse at the output of a combinational logic network â€“ **a momentary change** in an output that should not have changed
- A circuit with *the potential for a glitch* is said to have a **hazard**
- In other words a hazard is something intrinsic about a circuit; a circuit with hazard may or may not have a glitch depending on input patterns and the electric characteristics of the circuit.



#### When do circuits have hazards ?

Hazards are potential unwanted transients that occur in the output when different paths from input to output have different propagation delays

#### Types of Hazards (on an output)

static 1-hazard, static 0-hazard, dynamic hazard

#### Hazard's Concern

- Hazards do not hurt synchronous circuits
- Hazards Kill Asynchronous Circuits
- Glitches Increase Power Consumption
