## loop inductance

Determine the *complete current loop path* in order to calculate loop inductance of that current loop

> The complete path for the current depends on the frequency of the current. For one frequency, the return current will take a particular path, but for a higher frequency the path of the return current may be entirely different!





## partial inductance

> The first problem with using *loop inductance* to model the conductors of a loop is that at different frequencies, the return path
