Jitter separation lets you learn if the components of jitter are random or deterministic. That is, if they are caused by crosstalk, channel loss, or some other phenomenon. The identification of jitter and noise sources is critical when debugging failure sources in the transmission of high-speed serial signals

## Spectral method

>  power spectral density (PSD) represents jitter spectrum and peaks in the spectrum can be interpreted as PJ or DDJ, while the average noise floor is the power of RJ

```matlab
S1 = sum(win);
S2 = sum(win.^2);
N = length(win);
spec_nospur2 = (spec_nospur*S1).^2/N/S2;    % To obtain linear spectrum for rj
rj_utj = sqrt(sum(spec_nospur2))*1e12;

spec = 1*ones(length(spec_nospur), 1)*1e-21;
spec(index) = specx(index);
% insert fft nyquist frequency component between positive frequency and
% negative frequency component
% DC;posFreq;nyqFreq;negFreq
spec_ifft = [spec;specnyq;conj(spec(end:-1:2))]';
sfactor = sum(win)/sqrt(2);
spec_ifft = spec_ifft*sfactor;
sig_rec = real(ifft(spec_ifft));
sig_rec = sig_rec(:);
sig_rec_utj = sig_rec./win(1:end);
```



## Tail Fit Method

> Tail fitting algorithm based on the **Gaussian tail model** by using probability distribution of collected jitter value

```matlab
bin_sig = bin_sig*1e12;

x = qfuncinv(cdf_sig);

% coef(1)*bin_sig + coef(2) = x
% which x is norm(0, 1)
% bin_sig = (x - coef(2))/coef(1)
% Then bin is norm(-coef(2)/coef(1), 1/coef(1))
coef = polyfit(bin_sig, x, 1);
sigma = 1/coef(1);
mu = -coef(2)*sigma;

fprintf('sigma=%.3fps, mu=%.3fps\n', sigma, mu);
```

## Least Squares (LS) method

 It is known that TIE jitter is a linear equation, shown in below formula
$$
x[n] = d_n \times \left[ \Delta t_{pj}[n]+\Delta t_{DCD}[n] +\Delta t_{ISI}[n]+\Delta t_{RJ}[n]\right]
$$
LS can be used to estimate the PJ, DCD, RJ , and ISI parameters $[a,b,J_{DCD},J_0, J_1...J_{(2^k-1)}]$

## Jitter modeling

### Periodic Jitter (PJ)

PJ is a repeating jitter
$$
\Delta t_{PJ}[n]=A\sin(2\pi f_0\cdot nT_s + \theta)=a \sin(2\pi f_0 \cdot nT_s)+b\cos(2\pi f_0 \cdot nT_s)
$$
where $f_0$ represents the fundamental frequency of PJ; $A$ is the amplitude of PJ; $T_s$ is the data stream period, and $\theta$ is the initial phase of PJ

> In the spectrum, the frequency of maximum amount of the jitter is PJ frequency $f_0$.

### Duty Cycle Distortion (DCD)

DCD is viewed as a series of **adjacent positive and negative impulses**
$$
\Delta t_{DCD}[n] = J_{DCD}\times (-1)^n = [-J_{DCD},J_{DCD},-J_{DCD},J_{DCD},...]
$$
Where $J_{DCD}$ is the DCD amplitude.

###  Random Jitter (RJ)

RJ is created by unbounded jitter sources, such as Gaussian white noise. The statistical PDF for RJ is enerally treated as a Gaussian distribution
$$
f_{RJ}(\Delta t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma}}\exp(-\frac{(\Delta t)^2}{2\sigma^2})
$$
