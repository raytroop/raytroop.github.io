## Why Your Symmetric Layouts Are Showing Mismatches in SPICE Simulations

> [[https://www.ansys.com/blog/symmetric-layouts-showing-mismatches-spice-simulations](https://www.ansys.com/blog/symmetric-layouts-showing-mismatches-spice-simulations)]



![figure-2](layout/figure-2-18wid=609&fmt=png-alpha&op_usm=0.9,1.png)

The root cause of the delay mismatch is related to *how parasitic extraction tools distribute coupling capacitances over the nodes of the resistive networks*

> The most likely reason for such asymmetry is the anisotropy of computational geometry algorithms used by extraction tools.

## STRAP

## Antenna Effect

The **antenna effect** is a common name for the effects of *charge accumulation* in *isolated nodes* of an integrated circuit *during its processing*.

> This effect is also sometimes called "Plasma Induced Damage", "Process Induced Damage" (PID) or "charging effect".



### antenna ratio

The antenna rule specifies the maximum tolerance for the ratio of a metal line area to the area of connected gates.


### metal jumping

Long metal can be taken to *higher metal* routing layer. This is known as **metal jumping**. 

> This metal jumping will break the long interconnect and hence the charge collected on the long interconnect will not discharge through gate oxide because the higher metal layer is not yet fabricated. 

> so, if the gate immediately connects to the highest level by jump-up metals, large amount of charges can not be collected, while the poly finally connected to the diffusion part by highest level, thus no antenna violation will normally occure.

### Diode Insertion

Diode helps dissipate charges accumulated on metal. Diode should be placed as near as possible to the gate of device on low level of metal.

> Diode should always be connected in *reverse bias*, with cathode connected to gate electrode and anode connected to ground potential.
>
> During processing, even if the diodes are reversely biased, because of the elevated wafer temperature ($200 ^oC$ plus) it will provide a much conductive path
>
> In the reverse bias region, the reverse saturation current of Si and Ge diodes doubles for every $10 ^oC$ rise in temperature

### Stacked MOSFETs


## Matching

1. Common Centroid

   The common centroid technique describes that if there are n blocks which are to be matched then the blocks are arranged symmetrically around the common centre at equal distances from the centre. This technique offers best matching for devices as it helps in avoiding cross-chip gradients

   ![HTML5 Icon](layout/figure13.jpeg)

2. Inter-digitation

   Interdigitation reduces the device mismatch as it suffers equally from process variations in X dimension. This technique was used to layout current mirrors and resistors in PTAT and BGR circuits. In the Figure-15 below each brown stick represents a PFET of uniform length. This representation is termed as an inter-digitated layout.

### Layout Consideration

#### PODE & CPODE

> The PODE devices is extracted as parasitic devices in post-layout netlist

![image-20220213172653116](layout/image-20220213172653116.png)



**DDB** is the **PODE** (Poly on OD/Diffusion Edge) in TSMC 16FFC process.

**SDB** is the **CPODE** (Connected PODE) in TSMC 16FFC process.

> PO on OD edge (PODE) is a must and to define GATE that abuts OD vertical edge
>
> CPODE is used to connect two PODE cells together. It will isolate OD to save 1 poly pitch, via STI; Additional mask (12N) is required for manufacture



![image-20221210145232826](layout/image-20221210145232826.png)

![image-20221210150847737](layout/image-20221210150847737.png)

![image-20240509205506112](layout/image-20240509205506112.png)

#### SAC & SAGC

##### self-aligned diffusion contacts (SACs)

As shown in Fig. 35 in older planar technology nodes, gate pitch is so relaxed such that S/D contacts and gate contacts can easily be placed next to each other without causing any shorting risk (see Fig. 35(a)).

**As the gate pitch scales, there’s no room to put gate contacts next to S/D contacts, and gatecontacts have been pushed away from the active region and are only placed on the STI region.**

![image-20230708221916716](layout/image-20230708221916716.png)

In addition, at tight gate pitch, even forming *S/D contact* without shorting to *gate metal* becomes very challenging.

The idea of **self-aligned contacts (SAC)** has been introduced to mitigate the issue of S/D contact to gate shorts.

As shown in Fig. 35(b), *the gate metal is fully encapsulated by a dielectric spacer and gate cap*, which protects the gate from shorting to the S/D contact.

![image-20230708230238362](layout/image-20230708230238362.png)



>  A dielectric cap is added on top of the gate so that if the contact overlaps the gate, no short occurs.
>
>  **MD** layer represent SACs in PDK

![image-20230709005334372](layout/image-20230709005334372.png)



##### self-aligned gate contacts (SAGCs)

**Self-aligned gate contacts (SAGCs)** have also been implemented and Denser standard cells can be achieved by eliminating the need to land contacts on the gate outside the active area.

SAGCs require the source/drain contacts to be capped with an insulator that is different from both contact and gate cap dielectrics to protect the source/drain contacts against a misaligned gate contact etch.



![image-20230708233009568](layout/image-20230708233009568.png)



![image-20230708232429240](layout/image-20230708232429240.png)

> According to the DRC of T foundary, poly extension > 0 um and space between MP and OD > 0 um., which demonstrate self-aligned gate contact is **not** introduced.





##### Contacted-Poly-Pitch (CPP)

> Wider Contacted-Poly-Pitch allows wider MD and VD size, which help reduce MEOL IRdrop

![Schematic representation of a logic standard cell layout (CPP = contacted poly pitch, FP = fin pitch, MP = metal pitch; cell height = number of metal lines per cell x MP).](layout/imageurl=%252Fsites%252Fdefault%252Ffiles%252F2022-02%252FFigure%201%20-%20Logic%20standard%20cell%20scaling.jpeg)

A **native layer (NT_N)** is usually added under inductors or transformers in the nanoscale CMOS to define the non-doped high-resistance region of substrate, which decreases eddy currents in the substrate thus maintaining high Q of the coils.

> For T* PDK offered inductor, a native substrate region is created under the inductor coil to minimize *eddy currents* 

![image-20230810000702597](layout/image-20230810000702597.png)



> OD inside NT_N only can be used for NT_N potential pickup purpose, such as the guarding-ring of MOM and inductor

### CMOS Processing Technology

*Four main CMOS technologies:*

- *p-well process*
- *twin-tub process*
- *silicon on insulator*





Triple well, Deep N-Well (optional):

- NWell:  NMOS svt, lvt, ulvt ...
- PWell: PMOS svt, lvt, ulvt ...
- DNW:  For isolating P-Well from the substrate

> The NT_N drawn layer adds **no** process cost and **no** extra mask
>
> The N-well / P-well technology, where n-type diffusion is done over a p-type substrate or p-type diffusion is done over n-type substrate respectively.
>
> The **Twin well technology**, where **NMOS and PMOS transistor** are developed over the wafer by simultaneous diffusion over an epitaxial growth base, rather than a substrate.

### Substrate noise

A variety of techniques can be used to minimize this noise, for example by keeping analog devices surrounded by guard rings, or using a separate supply for the substrate/well taps. 

However *guard rings alone cannot prevent noise coupling deep in the substrate, only surface currents*.

> PMOS are less noisy than NMOS since PMOS has its nwell which isolates the substrate noise, but such is not valid for NMOS .



### DNW

The N-channel devices built directly into the P-type substrate are not as effectively isolated as P-channel devices in their N-wells. This is because despite creating a P+ guard ring around the devices, there remains an electrical path below the guard ring for charge to flow. 

To overcome this issue, a *deep N-well* can be used to more effectively isolate these N-channel devices.

![image-20230529002733114](layout/image-20230529002733114.png)

- the P-well is separated, allowing the voltage to be controlled
- because the circuit within the deep N-well is separated from the p-substrate in this structure,
  there is the benefit that this circuitry is less susceptible to noise that propagates through the p-substrate.
