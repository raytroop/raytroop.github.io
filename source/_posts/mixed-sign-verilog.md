Sign Extension

1) Calculate the necessary minimum width of the sum so that it contains all input possibilities
2) Extend the inputs' sign bits to the width of the answer
3) Add as usual
4) Ignore bits that ripple to the left of the answer's MSB

1. **signed**

|               | inA (signed) | inB (signed) | outSum<br />(signed/unsigned) |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
|               | 0101 (5)     | 1111 (-1)    |                               |
| *extend sign* | **0**0101    | **1**1111    |                               |
| *sum result*  |              |              | 00100                         |
```verilog
module tb;
	reg signed [3:0] inA;
	reg signed [3:0] inB;
    reg signed [4:0] outSumSg;	// signed result
    reg [4:0] outSumUs;			// unsigned result

	initial begin
		inA = 4'b0101;
		inB = 4'b1111;
		outSumUs = inA + inB;
		outSumSg = inA + inB;

		$display("signed out(%%d): %0d", outSumSg);
		$display("signed out(%%b): %b", outSumSg);

		$display("unsigned out(%%d): %0d", outSumUs);
		$display("unsigned out(%%b): %b", outSumUs);
	end
endmodule
```
2. **mixed**

|               | inA (signed) | inB (unsigned) | outSum<br />(signed/unsigned) |
| ------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------- |
|               | 0101 (5)     | 1111 (15)      |                               |
| *extend sign* | **0**0101    | **0**1111      |                               |
| *sum result*  |              |                | 10100                         |
```verilog
reg signed [3:0] inA;
reg [3:0] inB;
```
|               | inA (unsigned) | inB (signed) | outSum<br />(signed/unsigned) |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
|               | 0101 (5)       | 1111 (-1)    |                               |
| *extend sign* | **0**0101      | **0**1111    |                               |
| *sum result*  |                |              | 10100                         |

```verilog
module tb;
	reg [3:0] inA;
	reg signed [3:0] inB;
	reg signed [4:0] outSumSg;
	reg [4:0] outSumUs;

	initial begin
		inA = 4'b0101;
		inB = 4'b1111;
		outSumUs = inA + inB;
		outSumSg = inA + inB;

		$display("signed out(%%d): %0d", outSumSg);
		$display("signed out(%%b): %b", outSumSg);

		$display("unsigned out(%%d): %0d", outSumUs);
		$display("unsigned out(%%b): %b", outSumUs);

### observation

> When *signed* and *unsigned* is **mixed**, the result is by default **unsigned**. 
>
> Prepend to operands with **0**s instead of extending sign, even though the operands is signed
>
> LHS **DONT** affect how the simulator operate on the operands but what the results represent, signed or unsigned



Therefore, although `outSumUs` is declared as signed, its result is unsigned

#### subtraction example

In logic arithmetic, addition and subtraction are commonly used for digital design. Subtraction is similar to addition except that the subtracted number is 2's complement. By using 2's complement for the subtracted number, both addition and subtraction can be unified to using addition only.

##### operands are signed

|               | inA (signed) | inB (signed) | outSub<br />(signed/unsigned) |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
|               | 1111 (-1)    | 0010 (2)     |                               |
| *extend sign* | **1**1111    | **0**0010    |                               |
| *sub result*  |              |              | 11101                         |

```verilog
module tb;
	reg signed [3:0] inA;
	reg signed [3:0] inB;
	reg signed [4:0] outSubSg;
	reg [4:0] outSubUs;

	initial begin
		inA = 4'b1111;
		inB = 4'b0010;
		outSubUs = inA - inB;
		outSubSg = inA - inB;

		$display("signed out(%%d): %0d", outSubSg);
		$display("signed out(%%b): %b", outSubSg);

		$display("unsigned out(%%d): %0d", outSubUs);
		$display("unsigned out(%%b): %b", outSubUs);
	end
endmodule

### Danger Sign

[https://projectf.io/posts/numbers-in-verilog/](https://projectf.io/posts/numbers-in-verilog/)

> Verilog has a nasty habit of treating everything as unsigned unless all variables in an expression are signed. To add insult to injury, most tools wonâ€™t warn you if signed values are being ignored.

> If you take one thing away from this post:

> **Never mix signed and unsigned variables in one expression!**

```verilog
module signed_tb ();
    logic [7:0] x;  // 'x' is unsigned
    logic signed [7:0] y;  // 'y' is signed
    logic signed [7:0] x1, y1;
    logic signed [3:0] move;

    always_comb begin
        x1 = x + move;  // !? DANGER: 'x' is unsigned but 'move' is signed
        y1 = y + move;
    end

    initial begin
        #10
        $display("Coordinates (7,7):");
        x = 8'd7;
        y = 8'd7;
        #10
        $display("x : %b  %d", x, x);
        $display("y : %b  %d", y, y);

        #10
        $display("Move +4:");
        move = 4'sd4;  // signed positive value
        #10
        $display("x1: %b  %d  *LOOKS OK*", x1, x1);
        $display("y1: %b  %d", y1, y1);

        #10
        $display("Move -4:");
        move = -4'sd4;  // signed negative value
        #10
        $display("x1: %b  %d  *SURPRISE*", x1, x1);     // 0000_0111 + {0000}_1100 = 0001_0011
        $display("y1: %b  %d", y1, y1);                 // 0000_0111 + {1111}_1100 = 0000_0011
