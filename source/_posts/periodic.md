## PSS and HB Overview

The steady-state response is the response that results after any transient effects have dissipated. 

**The large signal solution is the starting point for small-signal analyses**, including periodic AC, periodic transfer function, periodic noise, periodic stability, and periodic scattering parameter analyses.

> Designers refer periodic steady state analysis in *time domain* as **"PSS"** and corresponding *frequency domain* notation as **"HB"**

## Harmonic Balance Analysis

The idea of harmonic balance is to find a set of port voltage waveforms (or, alternatively, the harmonic voltage components) that give the same currents in both the *linear-network equations* and *nonlinear-network equations*

> that is, the currents satisfy Kirchoff's current law

Define an **error function** at *each harmonic*, $f_k$, where
$$
f_k = I_{\text{LIN}}(k\omega) + I_{\text{NL}}(k\omega)
$$
where $k=0, 1, 2,...,K$

> Note that each $f_k$ is implicitly a function of all voltage components $V(k\omega)$

### Newton Solution of the Harmonic-Balance Equation

#### Iterative Process and Jacobian Formulation

![image-20231108222451147](periodic/image-20231108222451147.png)

The elements of the Jacobian are the derivatives
$$
\frac{\partial F_{\text{n,k}}}{\partial _{V_\text{m,l}}}
$$
where $n$ and $m$ are the port indices $(1,N)$, and $k$ and $l$ are the harmonic indices $(0,...,K)$



#### Selecting the Number of Harmonics and Time Samples

In theory, the waveforms generated in nonlinear analysis have an infinite number of harmonics, so a complete
description of the operation of a **nonlinear** circuit would appear to require current and voltage vectors of *infinite* dimension.

Fortunately, the magnitudes of frequency components invariably decrease with frequency; otherwise the time wavefroms would represent infinite power.

#### Initial Estimate

One important property of Newton's method is that its speed and reliability of convergence depend strongly upon the initial estimate of the solution vector.

## Nonlinearity & Linear Time-Varying  Nature

### Nonlinearity Nature

The nonlinearity causes the signal to be replicated at multiples of the carrier, an effect referred to as **harmonic distortion**, and adds a skirt to the signal that increases its bandwidth, an effect referred to as **intermodulation distortion**

![image-20231029093504162](periodic/image-20231029093504162.png)

> It is possible to eliminate the effect of *harmonic distortion* with a bandpass filter, however the frequency of the *intermodulation distortion* products overlaps the frequency of the desired signal, and so cannot be completely removed with filtering.

### Time-Varying Linear Nature

![image-20231029101042671](periodic/image-20231029101042671.png)

> **linear** with respect to $v_{in}$ and **time-varying**

Given $v_{in}(t)=m(t)\cos (\omega_c t)$ and LO signal of $\cos(\omega_{LO} t)$, then
$$
v_{out}(t) = \text{LPF}\{m(t)\cos(\omega_c t)\cdot \cos(\omega_{LO} t)\}
$$
and
$$
v_{out}(t) = m(t)\cos((\omega_c - \omega_{LO})t)
$$

> A *linear periodically-varying* transfer function implements *frequency translation*



## Periodic small signal analyses

### Analysis in Simulator

1.  LPV analyses start by performing a periodic analysis to compute the **periodic operating point** with only the **large clock signal** applied (the LO, the clock, the carrier, etc.). 
2. The circuit is then **linearized about this time-varying operating point** (expand about the periodic equilibrium point with a Taylor series and discard all but the first-order term)
3. and the **small information signal** is applied. The response is calculated using linear time-varying analysis

> Versions of this type of small-signal analysis exists for both harmonic balance and shooting methods

> PAC is useful for predicting the output sidebands produced by a particular input signal
>
> PXF is best at predicting the input images for a particular output

### Conversion Matrix Analysis

**Large-signal/small-signal analysis**, or **conversion matrix analysis**, is useful for a large class of problems wherein a **nonlinear device** is driven, or "pumped" by a **single large sinusoidal signal**; another signal, much smaller, is applied; and we seek only the **linear response to the small signal**.

> The most common application of this technique is in the design of mixers and in nonlinear noise analysis

1. First, analyzing the **nonlinear device** under large-signal excitation only, where the harmonic-balance method can be applied
2. Then, the **nonlinear elements** in the device's equivalent circuit are then **linearized** to create **small-signal, linear, time-varying elements**
3. Finally, a **small-signal analysis** is performed  

#### Element Linearized

Below shows a **nonlinear resistive element**, which has the $I/V$ relationship $I=f(V)$. It is driven by a *large-signal voltage*

![image-20220511203515431](periodic/image-20220511203515431.png)

Assuming that $V$ consists of the sum of a large-signal component $V_0$ and a small-signal component $v$, with *Taylor series*
$$
f(V_0+v) = f(V_0)+\frac{d}{dV}f(V)|_{V=V_0}\cdot v+\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2}{dV^2}f(V)|_{V=V_0}\cdot v^2+...
$$
The small-signal, incremental current is found by subtracting the large-signal component of the current
$$
i(v)=I(V_0+v)-I(V_0)
$$
If $v \ll V_0$, $v^2$, $v^3$,... are negligible. Then,
$$
i(v) = \frac{d}{dV}f(V)|_{V=V_0}\cdot v
$$



$V_0$ need not be a *DC* quantity; it can be a **time-varying large-signal voltage** $V_L(t)$ and that $v=v(t)$, a function of time. Then
$$
i(t)=g(t)v(t)
$$
where $g(t)=\frac{d}{dV}f(V)|_{V=V_L(t)}$

> The *time-varying* conductance $g(t)$, is the derivative of the element's $I/V$ characteristic at the *large-signal voltage*
>
> By an analogous derivation, one could have a current-controlled resistor with the $V/I$ characteristic $V = f_R(I)$ and obtain the *small-signal* $v/i$ relation
> $$
> v(t) = r(t)i(t)
> $$
> where $r(t) = \frac{d}{dI}f_R(I)|_{I=I_L(t)}$

A **nonlinear element** excited by *two tones* supports currents and voltages at mixing frequencies $m\omega_1+n\omega_2$, where $m$ and $n$ are integers. If one of those tones, $\omega_1$ has such a **low level** that it does not generate harmonics and the other is a large-signal sinusoid at $\omega_p$, then the mixing frequencies are $\omega=\pm\omega_1+n\omega_p$, which shown in below figure

![image-20231108223600922](periodic/image-20231108223600922.png)

A more compact representation of the mixing frequencies is
$$
\omega_n=\omega_0+n\omega_p
$$
which includes only half of the mixing frequencies: 

- the negative components of the lower sidebands (**LSB**) 
- and the positive components of the upper sidebands (**USB**)

![image-20220511211336437](periodic/image-20220511211336437.png)

> For real signal, positive- and negative-frequency components are complex conjugate pairs


#### Conversion Matrix as Bridge

The **frequency-domain** currents and voltages in a *time-varying circuit element* are related by a **conversion matrix**

The *small-signal* voltage and current can be expressed in the frequency notation as
$$
v'(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}V_ne^{j\omega_nt}
$$
and
$$
i'(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}I_ne^{j\omega_nt}
$$
where $v'(t)$ and $i'(t)$ are **not** Fourier series due to $\omega_n=\omega_0+n\omega_p$

The conductance waveform $g(t)$ can be expressed by its **Fourier series**
$$
g(t)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}G_ne^{jn\omega_pt}
$$
Which is harmonics of *large-signal* $\omega_p$

Then the voltage and current are related by Ohm's law
$$
i'(t)=g(t)v'(t)
$$
Then
$$
\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}I_ke^{j\omega_kt}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}G_nV_me^{j\omega_{m+n}t}
$$

> A linear periodically-varying transfer function implements **frequency translation**



## Linear Time Varying

The response of a relaxed LTV system at a time $t$ due to an impulse applied at a time $t − \tau$ is denoted by $h(t, \tau)$

> The first argument in the impulse response denotes the time of observation. 
>
> The second argument indicates that the system was excited by an impulse launched at a time $\tau$ *prior to* the time of observation.
>
> Thus, the response of an LTV system not only depends on how long before the observation time it was excited by the impulse but also on the observation instant. 
>
> The output $y(t)$ of an initially relaxed LTV system with impulse response $h(t, \tau)$ is given by the convolution integral
> $$
> y(t) = \int_0^{\infty}h(t,\tau)x(t-\tau)d\tau
> $$
> Assuming $x(t) = e^{j2\pi f t}$
> $$
> y(t) = \int_0^{\infty}h(t,\tau)e^{j2\pi f (t-\tau)}d\tau = e^{j2\pi f t}\int_0^{\infty}h(t,\tau)e^{-j2\pi f\tau}d\tau
> $$
> The (*time-varying*) frequency response can be interpreted as
> $$
> H(j2\pi f, t) = \int_0^{\infty}h(t,\tau)e^{-j2\pi f\tau}d\tau
> $$
> Linear Periodically Time-Varying (LPTV) Systems, which is a special case of an LTV system whose impulse response satisfies
> $$
> h(t, \tau) = h(t+T_s, \tau)
> $$
> In other words, the response to an impulse remains unchanged if the time at which the output is observed ($t$) and the time at which the impulse is applied (denoted by $t_1$) are both shifted by $T_s$
> $$
> H(j2\pi f, t+T_s) = \int_0^{\infty}h(t+T_s,\tau)e^{-j2\pi f\tau}d\tau = \int_0^{\infty}h(t,\tau)e^{-j2\pi f\tau}d\tau = H(j2\pi f, t)
> $$
> $H(j2\pi f, t)$ of an LPTV system is periodic with timeperiod $T_s$, it can be expanded as a Fourier series in $t$, resulting in
> $$
> H(j2\pi f, t) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} H_k(j2\pi f)e^{j2\pi f_s k t}
> $$
> The coefficients of the Fourier series $H_k(j2\pi f)$ are given by 
> $$
> H_k(j2\pi f) = \frac{1}{T_s}\int_0^{T_s} H(j2\pi f, t) e^{-j2\pi k f_s t}dt
> $$
