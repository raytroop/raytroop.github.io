**Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**

The YUM version 4 (based on the upstream `DNF` project) method for removing kernels and keeping only the latest version and running kernel:

```bash
$ yum remove --oldinstallonly
```

From the `yum` man page:

```bash
dnf [options] remove --oldinstallonly
    Removes old installonly packages, keeping only latest versions and  version  of  running
    kernel.
```
