#### Problem

There is no network connection and device is not managed


```
$ nmcli device status
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE      CONNECTION
eth0    ethernet  unmanaged  --
lo      loopback  unmanaged  --
```

#### solution

```bash
sudo nmcli networking on
```

Then, **eth0** is connected

```
$ nmcli device status
DEVICE  TYPE      STATE      CONNECTION
eth0    ethernet  connected  Ethernet connection 1
lo      loopback  unmanaged  --
```
