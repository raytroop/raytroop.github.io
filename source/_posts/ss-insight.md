## The Problem of "Sinusoids Running Around Loops"

The representative of Fourier transform $\frac{1}{j\omega+j\omega_0}$ back in the time domain $e^{-j\omega_0 t}$ is **infinite extent in time**

> Running around a loop, chasing one's tail — these are thought pictures that only work in a discretized, time-sequenced conceptual framework that has a beginning and an end


***Fix in your mind that oscillations are a type of resonance***

## Nyquist rate & Nyquist frequency

- **Nyquist rate**

  The Nyquist rate is the **minimum sample rate** required to accurately measure a signal's highest frequency. It's equal to ***twice*** the highest frequency of the signal

- **Nyquist frequency**

  The Nyquist frequency is the highest frequency that can be **represented without aliasing** in a discrete signal. It's equal to ***half*** the sampling frequency

## Zero-order hold (ZOH)

$$
h_{ZOH}(t) = \text{rect}(\frac{t}{T} - \frac{1}{2}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
1 & : \ 0 \leq t \lt T \\
0 & : \ \text{otherwise}
\end{array} \right.
$$
The effective frequency response is the continuous Fourier transform of the impulse response
$$
H_{ZOH}(f) = \mathcal{F}\{h_{ZOH}(t)\} = T\frac{1-e^{j2\pi fT}}{j2\pi fT}=Te^{-j\pi fT}\text{sinc}(fT)
$$
where $\text{sinc}(x)$ is the normalized sinc function $\frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}$

The Laplace transform transfer function of the ZOH is found by substituting $s=j2\pi f$
$$
H_{ZOH}(s) = \mathcal{L}\{h_{ZOH}(t)\}=\frac{1-e^{-sT}}{s}
$$

## phase delay & group delay

- Phase delay directly measures the device or system time delay of *individual sinusoidal frequency components* in the **steady-state conditions**.
- In the ideal case the envelope delay is equal to the phase delay
- envelope delay is a more sensitive measure of aberrations than phase delay

steady-state at this frequency is a polarity flip; a 180 degrees phase shift; which is a transfer function of H(s)=-1. 
$$
H(s) = e^{j\pi}
$$
That is $\phi(\omega) = \pi$
$$
\tau_p = \frac{\pi}{\omega}
$$
and
$$
\tau_g = \frac{\partial \pi}{\partial \omega}=0

## System Type

> Control of Steady-State Error to Polynomial Inputs: System Type

![image-20240502232125317](ss-insight/image-20240502232125317.png)

control systems are assigned a **type** number according to the maximum degree of the 
input polynominal for which the steady-state error is a *finite constant*. i.e.

> - Type 0: Finite error to a step (position error) 
> - Type 1: Finite error to a ramp (velocity error)
> - Type 2: Finite error to a parabola (acceleration error)

The open-loop transfer function can be expressed as
$$
T(s) = \frac{K_n(s)}{s^n}
$$

where we collect all the terms except the pole ($s$) at eh origin into $K_n(s)$, 

The polynomial inputs, $r(t)=\frac{t^k}{k!} u(t)$, whose transform is
$$
R(s) = \frac{1}{s^{k+1}}
$$

Then the equation for the error is simply
$$
E(s) = \frac{1}{1+T(s)}R(s)
$$


Application of the *Final Value Theorem* to the error formula gives the result

$$\begin{align}
\lim _{t\to \infty} e(t) &= e_{ss} = \lim _{s\to 0} sE(s) \\
&= \lim _{s\to 0} s\frac{1}{1+\frac{K_n(s)}{s^n}}\frac{1}{s^{k+1}} \\
&= \lim _{s\to 0} \frac{s^n}{s^n + K_n}\frac{1}{s^k}
\end{align}$$

- if $n > k$, $e=0$
- if $n < k$, $e\to \infty$
- if $n=k$
  - $e_{ss} = \frac{1}{1+K_n}$ if $n=k=0$
  - $e_{ss} = \frac{1}{K_n}$ if $n=k \neq 0$​

where we define $K_n(0) = K_n$

Due to KCL and $u(t)=e^{j\omega t}$ and $y(t)=H(j\omega)e^{j\omega t}$, we have ODE:

$$\begin{align}
\frac{u(t) - y(t)}{R} = C \frac{dy(t)}{dt} \\
e^{j\omega t} - H(j\omega) e^{j\omega t} = H(j\omega)\cdot j\omega e^{j\omega t} \\
\end{align}$$

$H(j\omega)$ is obtained as below
$$
H(j\omega) = \frac{1}{1+j\omega}
$$

## Different Variants of the PSD Definition

In the practice of engineering, it has become customary to use slightly different variants of the PSD definition, depending on the particular application or research field. 

- **Two-Sided PSD**, $S_x(f)$

  this is a synonym of the PSD defined as the Fourier Transform of the **autocorrelation**.

- **One-Sided PSD**, $S'_x(f)$

   this is a variant derived from the *two-sided PSD* by considering only the *positive frequency* semi-axis.

  To **conserve the total power**, the value of the one-sided PSD is **twice** that of the two-sided PSD
  $$
  S'_x(f) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
  0 & : \ f \geq 0 \\
  S_x(f) & : \ f = 0 \\
  2S_x(f) & : \ f \gt 0 
  \end{array} \right.
  $$
  



![image-20230603185546658](ss-insight/image-20230603185546658.png)  



> Note that the one-sided PSD definition makes sense only if the two-sided is an even function of $f$



If $S'_x(f)$ is even symmetrical around a positive frequency $f_0$, then two additional definitions can be adopted:

- **Single-Sideband PSD**, $S_{SSB,x}(f)$

  This is obtained from $S'_x(f)$ by moving the origin of the frequency axis to $f_0$
  $$
  S_{SSB,x}(f) =S'_x(f+f_0)
  $$
  This concept is particularly useful for describing phase or amplitude modulation schemes in wireless communications, where $f_0$ is the carrier frequency. 

  > Note that there is no difference in the values of the one-sided versus the SSB PSD; it is just a pure translation on the frequency axis. 

- **Double-Sideband PSD**, $S_{DSB,x}(f)$

  this is a variant of the SSB PSD obtained by considering only the positive frequency semi-axis.

  As in the case of the one-sided PSD, to conserve total power, the value of the DSB PSD is twice that of the SSB
  $$
  S_{DSB,x}(f) = \left\{ \begin{array}{cl}
  0 & : \ f \geq 0 \\
  S_{SSB,x}(f) & : \ f = 0 \\
  2S_{SSB,x}(f) & : \ f \gt 0 
  \end{array} \right.
  $$

\end{align}$$

system response $y(t)$ of input $\cos(\omega_0 t)$, note $\cos(\omega_0t) = \frac{1}{2}(e^{j\omega_0 t} + e^{-j\omega_0 t})$
$$\begin{align}

magnitude and phase at $\omega_0$ and $-\omega_0$
$$\begin{align}
H(j\omega_0) &= 1+j = \sqrt{2}e^{j\pi/4} \\
H(-j\omega_0) &= 1-j = \sqrt{2}e^{-j\pi/4}
\end{align}$$

system response $y(t)$ of input $\cos(\omega_0 t)$, note $\cos(\omega_0t) = \frac{1}{2}(e^{j\omega_0 t} + e^{-j\omega_0 t})$
$$\begin{align}
y(t) &= H(j\omega_0)\cdot \frac{1}{2}e^{j\omega_0 t} + H(-j\omega_0)\cdot \frac{1}{2}e^{-j\omega_0 t} \\
&=  \sqrt{2}\cos(\omega_0t+\pi/4)
\end{align}$$


## baud rate

**symbol rate**, **modulation rate** or **baud rate** is the number of symbol changes per unit of time.

- Bit rate refers to the number of **bits** transmitted between two devices per unit of time
- The baud or symbol rate refers to the number of **symbols** that can be sent in the same amount of time
