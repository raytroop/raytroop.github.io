## Cascaded Integrator-Comb (CIC) filter

Let’s focus on decimation: if we decimate by a factor 4, we simply retain one output sample out of every 4 input samples.

In the example below, the downsampler at the right drops those 3 samples out of 4, and the output rate, $y^\prime(n)$, is one fourth of the input rate $x(n)$:

![moving_average_filters-decimation_trivial](vlsi-dsp/moving_average_filters-decimation_trivial.svg)
$$\begin{align}
Y(z) &= X(z)\frac{1-z^{-4}}{1-z^{-1}} \\
Y^\prime(\xi) &= \frac{1}{4}Y(\xi^{1/4}) = \frac{1}{4}X(\xi^{1/4})\frac{1-\xi^{-1}}{1-\xi^{-1/4}}
\end{align}$$

with $z=e^{j\Omega/f_s}$ and $\xi =z^4$, we have
$$
Y^\prime(z) = \frac{1}{4}X(z)\frac{1-z^{-4}}{1-z^{-1}}
$$

But if we're going to be throwing away 75% of the calculated values, can't we just move the downsampler from the end of the pipeline to somewhere in the middle? Right between the integrator stage and the comb stage? That answer is yes, but to keep the math working, ***we also need to divide the number of delay elements in the comb stage by the decimation rate***:

![moving_average_filters-decimation_smart](vlsi-dsp/moving_average_filters-decimation_smart.svg)

$$\begin{align}
A(z) &= X(z)\frac{1}{1-z^{-1}} \\
A^\prime(\xi) &= \frac{1}{4}A(\xi^{1/4}) = \frac{1}{4}X(\xi^{1/4})\frac{1}{1-\xi^{-1/4}} \\
Y^\prime(\xi) &= A^\prime(\xi) (1-\xi^{-1}) =  \frac{1}{4}X(\xi^{1/4})\frac{1-\xi^{-1}}{1-\xi^{-1/4}}
\end{align}$$

with $z=e^{j\Omega/f_s}$ and $\xi =z^4$, we have
$$
Y^\prime(z) = \frac{1}{4}X(z)\frac{1-z^{-4}}{1-z^{-1}}
$$

---

And we can do this just the same with cascaded sections (*without downsampler or updampler*) where *integrators and combs have been grouped*

- for **decimation**, the *integrators come first* and the *combs second* with the downsampler in between
- For **interpolation**, the reverse is true
  - the incoming sample rate is fraction of the outgoing sample rate, the combs must come first and the interpolators second
