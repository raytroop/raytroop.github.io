## Electromagnetic coupling

**Electric field coupling** (also called **capacitive coupling**) occurs when energy is coupled from one circuit to another through an **electric field**

**Magnetic field coupling** (also called **inductive coupling**) occurs when energy is coupled from one circuit to another through a **magnetic field**

For instance

- magnetic coupling between multiple inductors
- capacitive coupling between multiple transmission lines
